  <h1>Unlike a transition, which only plays through once after it’s been triggered, a CSS animation doesn’t require a triggering action and can be set to loop. You can make it repeat as many times as you want or set it to go on forever. You make this specification using the animation-iteration-count property, which lets you set its value in number of seconds or infinite.</h1>
